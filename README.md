== Setup
1. Ensure you have credentials set up
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS= # fill in path to credentials,json file
2. Install the necessary packages in your PIP environment
   The virtual environment set up for running artman should be sufficient (thought not all the those packages may be necessary)
   TODO: trim down the list of packages
